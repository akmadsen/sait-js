Create a Quiz
=============

1) Create 5 or more quiz questions with a total of 3 different types of inputs.

2) Display the questions on your page.

3) Require that each question be filled out.

4) When a user submits the quiz, score it and display their score.

5) Once you've finished creating your quiz, modify your code to only show one quiz question at a time.

6) Consider everything you've learned up through now. Make your quiz look and feel good. This could be a potential project for your portfolio.

7) When you are done, create a Github page for this project and submit a link to the actual quiz website.

**If you have questions about your code, please email me the Github page link or your repository link. Please don't copy/paste your code into email. Thank you.**
